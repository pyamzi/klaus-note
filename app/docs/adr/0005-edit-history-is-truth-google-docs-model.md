# Material edits are a server-ordered history, Google Docs style

> Domain superseded by ADR-0008: klaus.ink is now klaus.so (app.klaus.so for the Klaus account, note.klaus.so for the web app).

So Materials can later be co-edited live, every edit to a Material (Page text, Document annotations and Links) is recorded as an operation in an edit history, the way Google Docs works: with a Klaus Account, klaus.ink orders and stores the history and is authoritative; offline edits queue locally and merge on reconnect; without an account the local history is authoritative. The `.md` and `.pdf` files are regenerated from the history after every change, and edits made to them by outside tools are detected, diffed, and folded back in as operations.

## Considered Options

- File as truth, merged at sync time: simpler, but cannot grow into live co-editing without migrating every user's data.

## Consequences

The edit history is real user data: it must be backed up, and it is the only non-file source data in Klaus (amends ADR-0002). Whether the merge algorithm is OT or a CRDT (Yjs, Loro, Automerge) is an implementation choice left open.

## Amendment (2026-10-06): lecture portability

For Lectures, [ADR-0009](0009-lecture-files-preserve-current-content.md) requires the lecture folder to restore all current content without an account or separate edit history. History may additionally preserve undo and collaboration. The policy above remains in effect for general Materials.
